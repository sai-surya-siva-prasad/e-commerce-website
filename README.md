Name of the Project: React Responsive, Fullstack, Ecommerce App

Description: This project involves building a full-stack, responsive e-commerce application from scratch. The application allows users to add products into a cart, fill out a form with their information, and make payments through Stripe. The backend of the application is supported by Strapi.

Technologies Being Used:

React: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
Material UI: A popular React UI framework.
Stripe: An online payment processing platform.
Formik: A small library that helps with the 3 most annoying parts: getting values in and out of form state, validation and error messages, and handling form submission.
Yup: A JavaScript schema builder for value parsing and validation.
Strapi: An open-source headless CMS to build, deploy and manage content.
Redux Toolkit: The official, opinionated, batteries-included toolset for efficient Redux development.



What Have You Learned: From this project, you can learn how to build a full-stack e-commerce application using React and various other technologies. You will gain hands-on experience with Stripe for payment processing, Formik for form handling, Yup for validation, and Strapi for backend support. You will also learn how to make the application responsive using Material UI and manage application state using Redux Toolkit.
